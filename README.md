Repository and Code Snippets that Ginny Li created for her Master's thesis around the cacti project in the Dr. Peter Facchini lab (2023-2025). Majority of the bioinformatics work is self-taught from reading guides. 

Guidance was provided from Dr. Sam Yeaman using the methods from his past paper: 
Li, Q., Ramasamy, S., Singh, P., Hagel, J. M., Dunemann, S. M., Chen, X., Chen, R., Yu, L., Tucker, J. E., Facchini, P. J., & Yeaman, S. (2020). Gene clustering and copy number variation in alkaloid metabolic pathways of opium poppy. Nature Communications, 11(1), 1190. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15040-2

Visuals and paper layout inspired by this dragon fruit paper: 
Zheng, J., Meinhardt, L. W., Goenaga, R., Zhang, D., & Yin, Y. (2021). The chromosome-level genome of dragon fruit reveals whole-genome duplication and chromosomal co-localization of betacyanin biosynthetic genes. Horticulture Research, 8(1), 63. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41438-021-00501-6


This repository features Unix Snippets that I used and may be helpful for future students of the Facchini lab. Refer to Bioinformatics Start Up guide for help tips and tricks. Refer back to the original program documents for the most up to date information.
